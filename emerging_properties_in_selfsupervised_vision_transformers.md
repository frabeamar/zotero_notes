What is the pretext task?

What is a momentum encoder?

- from Moco: train with constrastive loss (two crops from the same image need to be ‘classified as similar). you have a memory bank (well a queue) of similar example, you look for the key most similar to the query (self-supervised manner)

What is centering and sharpening

What are predictor, advanced normalization and contrastive loss, constrative estimator, stop gradient?

How are hard labels different from soft labels

you start with an untrained network? So you train your student to match the prediction of a random initialized network?

what is SSL

pre-norm layer normalization?

clustering hard-distillation?

so at every step the teacher is the average with exponential decay of the student, so moco but with cross entropy loss
